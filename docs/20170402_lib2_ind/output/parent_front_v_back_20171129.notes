We wanted to know how different from the line X=Y the relationship between
first 5 and last 5 generations gamma measurements looked, in order to better
characterize the choice of which interior timepoints to use.  We looked at the
parent guides here, and a parallel graph looked at the non-parent (including
off-strand) guides.  [In both cases we excluded guides for non-essentials.]
