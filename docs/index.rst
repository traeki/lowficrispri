Lab Notebook: Low-Fi CRISPRi
=======================================

dCas9-gRNA systems have been shown to successfully reduce transcriptional
expression of targeted genes.  We want to create CRISPRi systems in which the
degree of transcriptional knockdown is tunable not by varying induction levels
for the components, but rather by designing guides that vary in base sequence
so as to target less impactful parts of the CDS or match their target
imperfectly.
