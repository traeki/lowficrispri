META GOAL 1: Design Next Library
================================

* Identify most phenotypically informative guides in existing set
* Predict efficacy/information of future guides.

===============================================================
META GOAL 2: Extract Biological Insight From Growth Experiments
===============================================================

* Distinguish **Biology** vs. **Noise** vs. **Bias**
* Ascribe semantics to mathematical **Biology**

Questions
=========

1. How can we best estimate growth phenotypes?

  * What is "true gamma"? (gamma is not a fixed point, varies by context.)
  * Is SVD-smoothing data a good approximation?
  * How can we validate/evaluate our approximation?
  * How many components should we retain?

2. How can we best characterize/clean **Noise** and **Bias**?

  * Are noise/bias features reliably *sequestered* by SVD?
  * Are noise/bias features reliably *separated* by SVD?
  * Is PCA on transpose matrix a good path to predicting bias?

3. Can we use SVD to separate unknown effects from known effects?

  * In-condition vs. cross-condition (i.e. beak prevention)
  * Sequence effects vs. gene effects (i.e. guide design)
