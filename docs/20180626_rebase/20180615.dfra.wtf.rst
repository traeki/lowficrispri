What the fuck, dfrA
-------------------

Okay, so it looks like all the way back the dawn of time, the ordering of the dfrA
oligos got fucked in the eye.  So the code that assesses "highfi" for that file
was effectively noise.

TODO
====

* Extract the dna sequence of dfrA from the genome directly.
* Figure out which of the dfrA oligos are actually *in* that DNA.
* Label the rest based on ... best match
* ...
* Profit
