Pooled Growth Protocol
======================

Prep
----

-  Print this protocol
-  5 - 500 mL LB medium
-  1 - freezer stock tube of library #4
-  1 - freezer stock tube of library #3
-  1 - freezer stock tube of library #2
-  1 - freezer stock tube of library #1 CONTROLS!
-  10 x 1 L baffled flasks
-  Sample collection materials

   -  10 mL pipettes (sterile, disposable)
   -  spec cuvettes
   -  15 mL falcon conicals

Setup
-----

-  Measure strain library dilutions into LB at OD600 0.01

   -  .0005 <- Lib 1
   -  .0075 <- Lib 2
   -  .0010 <- Lib 3
   -  .0010 <- Lib 4

-  Dilute freezer stocks accordingly into 150 mL LB

   -  This is "Phase 0"

-  Prepare back-dilution media

   -  Two kinds of media

      -  Xylose [XN]
      -  10/9 Xylose [XNH]

   -  XN

      -  Draw off 50 mL from 1000
      -  Replace with 50 mL 20% Xylose

   -  XNH

      -  Draw off 75 mL from 500
      -  add back 25 mL 20% Xylose

-  Total media needed

   -  750 XN
   -  405 XNH
   -  150(+50) LB

-  Prepare back-dilution flasks

   -  Phase 1

      -  P1A: 135 mL XNH
      -  P1B: 135 mL XDH
      -  P1C: 135 mL XDH

   -  Phase 2

      -  P2A: 125 mL XN
      -  P2B: 125 mL XD
      -  P2C: 125 mL XD

   -  Phase 3

      -  P3A: 125 mL XN
      -  P3B: 125 mL XD
      -  P3C: 125 mL XD

Important Notes
---------------

-  TAKE +1 mL FOR EVERY SAMPLE TO MEASURE FINAL OD
-  Spin down samples and freeze or prep IMMEDIATELY after each phase.

Phase 0
-------

-  Incubate flask 0 (initial dilution) in 37 room on shaker
-  Warm back-dilutions in room
-  Track OD over time
-  Grow to OD 0.1 (~3 doublings)

   -  Take 2 \* 15 mL + 1 of T0 sample

-  Back dilute 10-fold

   -  15 mL into 135 mL
   -  P0 -> P1A
   -  P0 -> P1B
   -  P0 -> P1C

-  Samples ON ICE -> centrifuge -> freezer

Phase 1
-------

-  Continue incubation on 37 shaker
-  Grow to OD 0.3

   -  take 2 \* 5 mL (+1 mL) time points from P1A, P1B, P1C

-  Back dilute 6-fold

   -  25 mL into 125 mL medium
   -  P1A -> P2A
   -  P1B -> P2B
   -  P1C -> P2C

-  Samples on ice -> centrifuge -> freezer

Phase 2
-------

-  Continue incubation on 37 shaker
-  Grow to OD 0.3

   -  take 2 \* 5 mL (+1 mL) time points from P2A, P2B, P2C

-  Back dilute 6-fold

   -  25 mL into 125 mL medium
   -  P2A -> P3A
   -  P2B -> P3B
   -  P2C -> P3C

-  Samples on ice -> centrifuge -> freezer

Phase 3
-------

-  Continue incubation on 37 shaker
-  Grow to OD 0.3

   -  take 2 \* 5 mL (+1 mL) time points from P3A, P3B, P3C

-  Samples on ice -> centrifuge -> freezer

Done!
