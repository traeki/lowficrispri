Near-term Agenda
++++++++++++++++

First Tier
----------

* Fix the test data splitting.
* Add evaluation/prediction of some sort.
* "delta" -- subtractive vs. geometric...
* filter guides with low gammas...

* sampling across genes or families...

Second Tier
-----------

* Add cross of mismatch location (?)
* Add GC content
* Add proximal bases

Third Tier
----------

* Experiment with Neural Nets, Elastic Net, SVM, ...
* Experiment with hyperparameters like optimizer
* Build stub version of absolute predictor
* Figure out inverted prediction (i.e. directly design guide for efficacy)

Jason/Carol/Marco meeting 20180511
==================================

* Train on lib2, check out lib3/4 outcomes
* Experiment with larger thresholds for dropping parents
* Continue with Tier 2 work

Current Meeting 20180517
========================

* GC of parent as feature of delta
* Try
  * filtering on
  * or just using outright
  statistic of 5-fold groups

* Color datapoints with seed mutations
* Get a handle on the TensorBoard and refactor
