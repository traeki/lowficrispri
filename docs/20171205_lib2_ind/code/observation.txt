normalize raw_count column to normal_count
   -> groupby(day, tube, time).apply(normalization)
compute log_count
   -> log normal column
compute diffs
   -> get times for each day/tube
   -> for x < y
      -> compute t (end - start)
      -> compute diff allowing for threshold (modified by pseudo)
      -> subtract logs, filter on threholded raw counts

day	tube	start	end	t	parent	guide	diff

compute gamma:

groupby(day, tube)
   -> g, _ = np.polyfit(x.time, x.od, 1)
   -> nullmedian(day, tube, start, end) = diffs.loc[annos.control].median()
   -> gamma = (diff - nullmedian) / g * t

Figure out how to draw a simple graph again.  :-(
