Project Goals
-------------

John
++++

* Design Next Library

  * Identify most phenotypically informative guides in existing set
  * Predict efficacy/information of future guides.

* Extract Biological Insight From Growth Experiments

  * Distinguish **Biology** vs. **Noise** vs. **Bias**
  * Ascribe semantics to mathematical **Biology**

Carol
+++++

* Determining a set of mismatched guides with appropriate knockdown.

   * from completed initial triplicate replicates of essential kd and 2
     comprehensive libraries of dfrA and murAA, john will determine the
     following

    1. A series of guides expected to give knockdown in the appropriate range
       (close to no effect) + one that gives more significant knockdown.

    2. If possible, a set of "rules"  for guide design

  * John will redesign library consisting of selected guides, and if some
    general "rules" have been determined, see if he can make a useful library of
    auxotrophs as a test set.

* Using the mismatched guides to determine on and off target drug effects.

  * John already has fluorescence data with  several mismatched  guides with
    different  efficacies, in the absence and presence of drug,  He will
    compare these data with similar data from pooled experiments across all guides.
    My feeling is that these data will be complete, representing a stand alone
    figure.

  * John will use one or two more drug tests in the next redesigned library,
    using different targets, to determine whether his initial results that marginal
    knockdown leads to high drug sensitive are true across drugs.


Submapping Discussion
---------------------

* Can this be used to narrow the null space and expose more variation
