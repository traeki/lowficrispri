==============
Residual TODOs
==============

* Implement the average, cutoff, backoff approach and compare DCA-glob
  * Maybe recreate a'c'b *using* DCA, somehow
  * **Evaluate the corner cases.**
* Define the goals for what a library would be (both libraries)
  * Which genes
  * Guide properties
* Assemble first pass library designs and discuss
* "Normalize for per-gene effects" (I'm forgetting what that means...)
* Make a beak "prediction" that can be tested downstream.
* Take a swing at efficacy prediction, using DCA, sklearn, ...?
* Can I test the "controls are actually noisier than sicks" idea?
* Explore where genes are in the aggregate graph.

=============
20180314 Plan
=============

* Talk to Jason about library design
* Try to remember what "Normalize for per-gene effects" means, in case it
  matters
* Implement Martin's idea and/or re-create using DCA
