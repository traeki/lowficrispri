Near-term Agenda
++++++++++++++++

First Tier
----------

* Fix the test data splitting.
* Add evaluation/prediction of some sort.
* "delta" -- subtractive vs. geometric...
* filter guides with low gammas...

* sampling across genes or families...

Second Tier
-----------

* Add cross of mismatch location (?)
* Add GC content
* Add proximal bases

Third Tier
----------

* Experiment with Neural Nets, Elastic Net, SVM, ...
* Experiment with hyperparameters like optimizer
* Build stub version of absolute predictor
* Figure out inverted prediction (i.e. directly design guide for efficacy)
